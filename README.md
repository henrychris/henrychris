- ⚡ I started programming by making text-based games with BASIC to impress my friends.
- ⚡ I pivoted away from code to try a career in Consulting, but I couldn't stay away long.
- ⚡ I'm a backend engineer mainly using C# and TypeScript. I use Svelte when build fullstack applications.
- 🔭 I'm working on QSet + more, tools to improve the football experience in my country.
- 🏢 I'm looking for a role as a backend engineer- C# or TypeScript are fine. A startup with a small, tight-knit team would be excellent!
